        <p>Born in Indianapolis, I currently call Grand Rapids home. I went to school at Aquinas College <br>
            and majored in English and history. I also studied classical archaeology and studied in Tuscany <br>
            with the University of Massachusetts Amherst on their field school dig. I'm still very passionate <br>
            about archaeology and love to keep up with the latest finds and developments.
        </p>


        <p>Besides archaeology, I enjoy Irish dance and reading. I started Irish dancing when I was <br>
            in high school with the Ardan Academy out of Detroit. Now I dance with the Grand Rapids <br>
            based Scoil Rince Ni Bhraonain school, and have done for two years. My reading interests <br>
            include science fiction and anything that has to do with history.
